    <pre>Part 1: "Underground"
        Serving as an introduction into the mind of the narrator,
        the first part of Notes from Underground is split into nine chapters:
        
        The introduction propounds a number of riddles whose meanings are further developed
        as the narration continues.
        Chapters 2, 3, & 4 deal with suffering and the irrational pleasure of suffering.
        Chapters 5 & 6 discuss the moral and intellectual fluctuation that the narrator 
        feels along with his conscious insecurities regarding "inertia"—inaction.
        Chapters 7, 8, & 9 cover theories of reason and logic, closing with the last two chapters
        as a summary and transition into Part 2.
        The narrator observes that utopian society removes suffering and pain, but man desires
        both things and needs them to be happy. He argues that removing pain and suffering in
        society takes away a man's freedom. He says that the cruelty of society makes human
        beings moan about pain only to spread their suffering to others.
        
        Unlike most people, who typically act out of revenge because they believe justice
        is the end, the Underground Man is conscious of his problems and feels the desire
        for revenge, but he does not find it virtuous; the incongruity leads to spite towards
        the act itself with its concomitant circumstances. He feels that others like him exist,
        but he continuously concentrates on his spitefulness instead of on actions that would
        help him avoid the problems that torment him. The main issue for the Underground Man is
        that he has reached a point of ennui[4] and inactivity.[5] He even admits that he would
        rather be inactive out of laziness.
        
        The first part also gives a harsh criticism of determinism, as well as of intellectual
        attempts at dictating human action and behavior by logic, which the Underground Man
        discusses in terms of the simple math problem: two times two makes four
        (cf. necessitarianism). He argues that despite humanity's attempt to create the "Crystal
        Palace," a reference to a famous symbol of utopianism in Nikolai Chernyshevsky's What Is
        to Be Done?, one cannot avoid the simple fact that anyone, at any time, can decide to act
        in a way that might not be considered to be in their own self-interest; some will do so
        simply to validate their existence and to protest and confirm that they exist as individuals.
        The Underground Man ridicules the type of enlightened self-interest that Chernyshevsky
        proposes
        as the foundation of Utopian society. The idea of cultural and legislative systems relying
        on this rational egoism is what the protagonist despises. The Underground Man embraces this
        ideal in praxis, and seems to blame it for his current state of unhappiness.[6]
        
        Part 2: "Apropos of the Wet Snow"
        The second part of the story consists of three main segments that lead to a furthering of the
        Underground Man's consciousness.
        
        First segment
        The first segment is the Underground Man's obsession with an officer who has once
        disrespected him in a pub. This officer frequently passes by him on the street,
        seemingly without noticing his existence. He sees the officer on the street and thinks of
        ways to take revenge, eventually borrowing money to buy a higher class overcoat and bumping
         into the officer to assert his equality. To the Underground Man's surprise, however,
         the officer does not seem to notice that it even happened.
        
        Second segment
        The second segment is a going away dinner party with some old school friends to bid Zverkov,
        one of their number, goodbye as he is being transferred out of the city. The Underground Man
        hated them when he was younger, but after a random visit to Simonov's, he decides to meet
        them at the appointed location. They fail to tell him that the time has been changed to six
        instead of five, so he arrives early. He gets into an argument with the four of them after a
        short time, declaring to all his hatred of society and using them as the symbol of it.
        At the end, they go off without him to a secret brothel, and, in his rage, the underground
        man follows them there to confront Zverkov once and for all, regardless if he is beaten or
        not. He arrives at the brothel to find Zverkov and the others already retired with
        prostitutes to other rooms. He then encounters Liza, a young prostitute, with whom
        he goes to bed.
        
        Third segment
        The story cuts to Liza and the Underground Man lying silently in the dark together.
        The Underground Man confronts Liza with an image of her future, by which she is unmoved
        at first, but after challenging her individual utopian dreams (similar to his ridicule of
        the Crystal Palace in Part 1), she eventually realizes the plight of her position and how
        she will slowly become useless and will descend more and more, until she is no longer
        wanted by anyone. The thought of dying such a terribly disgraceful death brings her to
        realize her position, and she then finds herself enthralled by the Underground Man's
        seemingly poignant grasp of the destructive nature of society. He gives her his address
        and leaves.
        
        He is subsequently overcome by the fear of her actually arriving at his dilapidated
        apartment after appearing such a "hero" to her and, in the middle of an argument with
        his servant, she arrives. He then curses her and takes back everything he said to her,
        saying he was, in fact, laughing at her and reiterates the truth of her miserable position.
        Near the end of his painful rage he wells up in tears after saying that he was only seeking
        to have power over her and a desire to humiliate her. He begins to criticize himself
        and states that he is in fact horrified by his own poverty and embarrassed by his situation.
        Liza realizes how pitiful he is and tenderly embraces him. The Underground Man cries out
        "They—they won't let me—I—I can't be good!"
        
        After all this, he still acts terribly toward her, and, before she leaves, he stuffs a
        five ruble note into her hand, which she throws onto the table (it is implied that the
         Underground Man engaged in sexual activity with Liza and that the note is compensation
         for her). He tries to catch her as she goes out to the street but cannot find her and
         never hears from her again. He tries to stop the pain in his heart by "fantasizing."
        
        And isn't it better, won't it be better?… Insult—after all, it's a purification; it's
        the most caustic, painful consciousness! Only tomorrow I would have defiled her soul and
        wearied her heart. But now the insult will never ever die within her, and however repulsive
        the filth that awaits her, the insult will elevate her, it will cleanse her…
        
        He recalls this moment as making him unhappy whenever he thinks of it, yet again proving
        the fact from the first section that his spite for society and his inability to act like
        it makes him unable to act better than it.
        
        The concluding sentences recall some of the themes explored in the first part,
        and tells the reader directly, "I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you
        have not dared to carry even halfway.” The work as a whole ends with a note from the author
        that while there was more to the text, "it seems that we may stop here."</pre>
